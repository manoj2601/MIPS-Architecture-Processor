# MIPS-Architecture-Processor
A simple VHDL model for a simple processor implementing a large subset of the MIPS instruction set. Simulated and synthesized the design by downloading the generated bit file int othe FPGA and run the processor on the board. A multi cycle pipelined Simulation model also implemented in C++.
